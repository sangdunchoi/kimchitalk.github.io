I  usually read blog of [Ed yong](https://twitter.com/edyong209?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor){:target="_blank"} science writer found him through twitter.

I happen to read this [article](http://phenomena.nationalgeographic.com/2016/04/19/why-some-snakebites-are-so-destructive/){:target="_blank"} and quite surprised by the work from India that too from an author I know. I happen to work with one of the corresponding author Dr. Kesturu Girish in one of the [paper](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0141813013000081){:target="_blank"} in Pondicherry University collaborated with University of Mysore.

See in the high level institutes in India they pour lots of money and do the works which are usually unrelated to Indian problems (I mean to say essential and significant to solve Indian problems). Also, they boost like big discovery or invention.

Here in the corner of India like [Dr.Girish](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kesthuru_Girish/publications){:target="_blank"} few works without any whispers. Few people are working in India without any whispers. I guess that makes Indian much more beautiful. Here is the [original paper](http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms11361){:target="_blank"}.

I happen to read the quote by [Joan Robinson](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Joan_Robinson){:target="_blank"} about India is quite apt here.

"The frustrating thing about India is that whatever you can rightly say about India, the opposite is also true".
