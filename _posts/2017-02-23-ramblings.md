I read [Kalam's beyond 2020 book](https://penguin.com.au/books/beyond-2020-a-vision-for-tomorrows-india-9780670087969) that I took from my friend Hardik's room. It is next version of [India 2020](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_2020) that I read long back. There were two pages about herbal, and he was discussing improving the exports citing [International trade center reports](http://www.intracen.org/itc/sectors/medicinal-plants/).

Concerning this, the other day one of my colleagues used this perfume [*Orange Blossom Cologne*](https://www.jomalone.com/product/3567/10106/shop-our-favourite-gifts/orange-blossom-cologne). I was curious to know the source of the smell that resembles and familiar with [*Pandanus odorifer* (தாழம்பூ)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandanus_odorifer). However, it turned to be these four varieties of flowers and roots viz:- [*Orris root*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orris_root), [*Water lily*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nymphaeaceae), [*Clementine*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clementine) (sort of orange (mandarin) hybrid) and [*Indian grass* (வெட்டிவேர்)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrysopogon_zizanioides). [Side note: Tamil and English names of flowers can be found [here](http://tamilcube.com/glossaries/indian-flowers.aspx). If you take this perfume company, it must have R&D wing. There they pay salaries to a group of scientists who will be inventing novel perfumes. Somehow in western as well as in a few Asian countries (Korea, Hong Kong, Singapore, Japan), there are partnerships between universities and industries in investment as well as in research. Here I will give an example in Singapore this [chemistry](http://www.nature.com/news/sustainability-don-t-waste-seafood-waste-1.18149) group is trying to convert waste crab, shrimp, and lobster shells into useful chemicals like calcium carbonate/pharmaceutical precursors. My experience is that we lack this, especially how to convert knowledge into wealth.


If you read [DBT India's annual reports](http://www.dbtindia.nic.in/annual-report/), they are trying to help private companies to fund for the products. For instance, I learned DBT supported a small scale industry to convert fish wastes into dog food. I think those contributions are very meager in quantity. Here own motivation is needed to initiate something new. Also, we don't have a bridge as a workshop to help Ph.D.'s to launch/apply their knowledge to create wealth, especially in India. At least I am not aware of it. There are workshop's, but mostly there are at the labor level, for instance, you visit any research institute (CFTRI/TNAU). For example, CFTRI has

* [Technology Database](http://www.cftri.com/technologies.php)
* [Business](http://118.151.209.71/joomla1/)
* [Free Technologies](http://freetech.cftri.com/freetech/)
* [Incubation Facility](http://118.151.209.71/npic/)
* [An entrepreneur](http://www.cftri.com/enterpreneur.php)

However, one can start from here and then we can apply our knowledge to take this to the next level. It is also tedious.


Once, I listened to [Prof. Jayanthasri Balakrishnan's](https://in.linkedin.com/in/jayanthasri-balakrishnan-a8845734) talk. I couldn't recall exactly, but the talk is on youtube. She told an example, in Japan, they have a unique way of handling problems. Whenever they have a problem, their bosses approach the problems enthusiastically to solve it. I understand working in Japan can be stressful, but the attitude towards the problem is beautiful. I think that's how we will have the energy to solve the problems. Where there is a problem, there is an opportunity. This attitude will shape or help us the so-called educated. [Kaaka Muttai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaaka_Muttai) movie director [manikandan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M._Manikandan) told in a talk that whenever he want to try something new mostly, he was discouraged stating that this is not possible. I think we have a mindset problem as a whole in India. Mostly this thread is for teachers/post-doc/Ph.D. So whenever someone comes with a something new or want to try, we have to be cautious at least not to discourage the person. If possible help otherwise it will be better not to discourage.


I was discussing with my friend Nilesh and learned that Ireland which has the similar population to Chennai that have [75 pharmaceutical companies](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/case-moving-ema-ireland-anna-rose-welch?trk=v-feed&lipi=urn:li:page:d_flagship3_feed%3Bz7ok60QYBDGzpAEHN7HFRw%3D%3D). I think our mindset is the main reason for the problems in our country including many other. The companies/small ventures in India are mostly from unorganized sector hard working labor. Their contributions are enormous compared to white collar jobs (5 or 10%). We the educated are very busy in supporting some wild parties (can be any party from Kejriwal/bhakts/congress crackpots). We should stop wasting time in defending any parties instead we must contribute our time and energy in creating something. The Tamil writer [JeyaMohan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B._Jeyamohan) once said in an interview that we (citizens) have enough technology to run a newspaper today without anybody's support. But, still, we don't bring any positive change. He meant the power of Internet and criticized the current attitude of the younger generation. Some people do but the proportion and the diversity are very less. We need people from different background to do that. For instance, in Korea, there are approximately 2000 working in research about 200 universities. I am sure about the number but more or less same. It applies only to research other than Samsung/Hyundai/MNC company workers. Even 100 (5%) of these can start a part time (Freelancer/Profit/Non-profit in India) that can bring a change. It will also boost many others confidence to start. These are a reflection of my thoughts and trying to criticize myself to create something. Sharing this with you simply because you might have preliminary interests in your area that you can nourish and convert those into a reality.

cheers!!!
