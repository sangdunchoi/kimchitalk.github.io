I guess it appears now the similar situation in India from elite parents. Education is very important but not like this one. One of the reasons for high suicide rate in Japan/Korea is due this kind of education. I like Japan/Korea in many ways but this hurts. Somehow, I feel lucky that I did born outside of Japan/Korea.


Why do even educated parents are not sensible?. Education does not make us sensibile. 

I would recommend the teachers/parents to listen these talks.

#### Sir Ken Robinson talk

#### Osho talk

The comments are alteast sensible.
