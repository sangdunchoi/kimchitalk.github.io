### Antidote for carbon monoxide poisoning

Carbon monoxide poisoning occurs breathing too much CO (colorless and oderless gas) usually occurs in fireplaces, burnout fuels (cars), gas or charcoal where they fail to fully combust due to a lack of oxygen in their surroundings. CO binds tightly to haemoglobin and prevents the oxygen transport that inhibits the process of respiration in mitochondrial cells. Scientists have tried and failed to free these bound CO from haemoglobin since CO binds 100 times (refer chemistry stackoverflow thread) strongly than oxygen. One group in pittsburgh university works in neuroglobin. They usually purify these neuroglobin protein where they observed it always bound to CO. Further, they need to do additional step remove CO inorder to purify these protein. During discussion they found neuroglobin can be used  as a antidote for CO poisoning. They also mutated the neuroglobin so that CO can bind 500 times stronger to it than haemoglobin which can be excreted through kidney. It is to be noted here that naturally we also have CO in minor amounts in the haemoglobin degradation pathway. Within 5 minutes of CO poisoning 87% of mice were saved. Till now there is a only one old treatment (almost for 50 years) using high-pressure oxygen. It is always interesting and inspiring to read these kind of news.
