Example of an Ishihara color test plate. The number "74" should be clearly visible to viewers with normal color vision. Viewers with dichromacy or anomalous trichromacy may read it as "21", and viewers with monochromacy may see nothing.

I tested in my friends circle. My friend prasanna turn to be color dichromacy. [You can test here](http://enchroma.com/test/instructions/). It seems his mother, sister also has difficulty in finding the color difference. [It is X-Linked Inheritance](http://knowgenetics.org/x-linked-inheritance/).
