Employees have to work for 14 hours a day. It is really strange to hear a gigantic Samsung did not approve to form unions for almost 75 years. It is really very hard for the single man to fight against a big empire. Still, I feel the video was not critical. Like every big company, Samsung also acquires each and every small startup's. Most of us are easily intimidated against power. These kind of news can only be available from outside of Korea. I read the book ["Capitalism a ghost story"](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/sep/30/capitalism-ghost-story-arundhati-roy-review-excess-corruption-laid-bare-india) by [Arundhati Roy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arundhati_Roy). Arundhati Roy did a remarkable work. A independent writer should tear apart the whole emphire like Roy. Some kind of resistance from independent journalist/media in Korea will help their employees. Every country has pros and cons. It is my opinion that South Korea is a beautiful country to live but not a good country to work.
