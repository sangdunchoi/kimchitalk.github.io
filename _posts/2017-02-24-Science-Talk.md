*Organic chemist Pranab K. Shyam did his doctorate in chemistry from University of Kalyani, India. Now, he works as a postdoctoral fellow in Ajou University, South Korea. He shares his work and experience.*




## Why chemistry?
Actually, my interest was in mathematics at high school. One of my school chemistry teacher Ramkrishna Dey motivated me to take chemistry and I followed his advice.

---

## Can you explain your PhD thesis?
My PhD thesis was related to material science and organic chemistry. It was multidisciplinary. Specifically, to synthesize several types of organic thermotropic liquid crystals and analyze their properties. 

---


## Can you explain what is a liquid crystal in simple terms?
We know that there are three states of matter viz., solid, liquid, and gas. There are many other intermediate phases of the matter. One of the important intermediate phases is the liquid crystal that contains both the properties of solid and liquid state. In liquid crystals, the molecules will be oriented in different direction depending on either temperature or concentration. And this makes liquid crystals interesting.

Mostly liquid crystals are of two types: [thermotropic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermotropic_crystal) and [lyotropic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermotropic_crystal). Thermotropic as you understand the word “[thermo](http://www.dictionary.com/browse/thermo-)” is a greek word meaning “hot” or “heat”. Thermotropic liquid crystals are sensitive to temperature. It has applications in Liquid-crystal-display televisions (LCD-TV), polarized sunglasses, laptop computers, calculators, digital cameras, digital clocks, microwave ovens timers, CD players, theromometers, moodrings etc. Whereas lyotropic liquid crystals will react to solvents that are used in soaps and detergents. I had created around 40 different types of organic liquid crystals during my PhD. Only few compounds had beautiful properties- it means that has direct applications.

## Any natural liquid crystals examples?
Liquid crystal phases of DNA at high concentrations

---
## What might be the future application of liquid crystals?
For instance, liquid crystals will be used in paints that changes the color due to temperature differences. Depending upon the light source the color of the paint changes. I guess even now it is commercially available in few countries.

---
## It seems your work have real time applications. Do you have any patents during PhD?
No. Our Indian professor has 300 papers but not even a single patent. Out of his 300 papers, there are a few very good projects that had a commercial value. However, there is no technology transfer centre to help us. I can understand not all the works are patentable but after three years stay in Korea I can see the difference in attitude. We don't have direct access to X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) machines in our university to analyze the properties of the liquid crystals. We sent our samples to [IISC](http://www.iisc.ac.in/) bangalore and usually it takes 3 to 6 months. Also, I guess they have too much work load. Since, most of the state universities depend on IISC facility. It will be helpful if we have several similar centers through the country. Time, samples and efforts are often wasted. This hampers the research especially in state universities. With limited facilities we published a beautiful property liquid crystal in journal of material chemistry. We publish the results and some other group/industry may exploit those ideas for a commercial purpose or for further research. 

---
## Do you had any fellowships during PhD?
I was a [CSIR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Scientific_and_Industrial_Research) fellow. 


---
## Do you aware of any company in India that gives XRD facility to help the researchers?
As far as I understand there are no company that provides the XRD facilities in India atleast in my state West Bengal. We dependent mostly on public funded institutions like [IISC](http://www.iisc.ac.in/). Few fortunate [CSIR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Scientific_and_Industrial_Research) labs have better facilities than a private university for instance, Ajou University in Korea. When I joined PhD, we didn't had even Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) facility in our lab. Then, we used to sent samples to small companies that does NMR.

---
## What special thing you like about your PhD advisor?
When I was doing PhD, sometimes my professor used to push me to finish the work and then it was irritating. Now I realized that his stand was correct. As a result, we published a handfull of papers. I learned many lessons both personally and professionally. I am thankful to my professor K.C. Majumdar. 

---
## What kind of work you do in Ajou University?
We choose the specific organic compounds that are published by others and try to synthesize it. We are finding ways to reduce the steps and thus economically viable. Recently, we filed a patent for our work.

---
## Do you like the job?
I like chemistry and doing research. I was enjoying my PhD. In India, notably in state universities, PhD students have to do several things starting from doing experiments, troubleshooting an instrument, writing paper and sometimes as a senior student even we help to write grants and follow the procedures. In addition, even we spent enough time on administrative duties. Perhaps, this is also true in several central universities also. At that moment it was stressing and exhausting. But, it helped me to learn several things. It is satisfying now. If we had more time to do research that could have been undoubtedly better. With three years of postdoctoral experience in Korea, I don't have any intellectually stimulating work in research. Even my professor writes the manuscript/paper. My Korean professor expects me to do the work what she says. Without challenging problems I don't learn. Without learning one cannot enjoy the work. Although, she appreciates my ideas and inputs but never implements it. It is discouraging. I expect her to consider my inputs in designing as well as executing the projects. It seems to me that I feel like I work in a company with a less pay. I meant to say the routine works.

---
## What about current professor in korea?
My professor is very good. However, only one thing is, here I lack academic freedom. She never forces any of her students. I think it is very rare in Korean environment. 

---
## What are the positive aspects of working in Korea?
First, funding is very good in Korea. This in turns boost the research infrastructure facilities. In addition, for eg; if i order chemicals before 11 a.m. I will get the chemicals by evening or early morning depending up on the stock. This saves a lot of time. If you consider India scenario in my state university it takes minimum 4 weeks. Even in big labs in [CSIR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Scientific_and_Industrial_Research) they have to wait for at least 10 days depending on the chemicals and availabilies. Secondly, most of the Korean universities have partnerships with industries. I guess most Korean labs look for commercial values in their work.

---
## How did you get your post-doc position in Korea.
Through my friend Dr.Avik Ranjan.

---
## Did you gave an Interview for the post-doc job?
I think Japan, Korea, China and many other Asian countries don't have Interviews. They usually prefer for recommendations rather than Interviews.

---
## Any advice for pursing PhD in chemistry?
I can suggest with the Indian scenario. Don't do PhD in state universities. I will suggest to join in either [CSIR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Scientific_and_Industrial_Research) labs, [IITs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Institutes_of_Technology) or [central universities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_universities). The funding and facilities are comparatively good. For instance, even few labs in [IISER, Pune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Institutes_of_Science_Education_and_Research) they have better facilities than South Korea especially in crystallography. One more thing is with good research facilities you will be more productive and it saves a lot of time. With these institute tags, one can land in the high-profile institutes.

---
## What are your future plans?
Actually, I like research but I think due to the current academic environment the chance to get a permanent position is going away from my hand. To start a lab in India or even in South Korea you must have a good recommendations or a high-profile to get an academic position. I can get a teaching job in private colleges in India but one cannot do research there. My strengths are in handling the experiments rather than on teaching. I have contract up to this August and after that I am planning to start something on my own. Let's see.


Thank you Pranab Shyam for your time.

Mood ring.

A mood ring is a ring that contains a thermochromic element, such as liquid crystal, that changes colors based upon the temperature of the finger of the wearer. Most new rings come with a color chart indicating the supposed mood of the wearer based upon the colors indicated on the ring.

The mood ring was created in 1975 by two New York inventors, Josh Reynolds and Maris Ambats, who bonded liquid crystals with quartz stones set into rings.They initially retailed for $45 for a "silvery setting" and $250 for gold, and first sold at Bonwit Teller, rapidly becoming a fad in the 1970s.

History of liquid crystals : From Wikipedia.

In 1888, Austrian botanical physiologist Friedrich Reinitzer, working at the Karl-Ferdinands-Universität, examined the physico-chemical properties of various derivatives of cholesterol which now belong to the class of materials known as cholesteric liquid crystals. Previously, other researchers had observed distinct color effects when cooling cholesterol derivatives just above the freezing point, but had not associated it with a new phenomenon. Reinitzer perceived that color changes in a derivative cholesteryl benzoate were not the most peculiar feature.

He found that cholesteryl benzoate does not melt in the same manner as other compounds, but has two melting points. At 145.5 °C (293.9 °F) it melts into a cloudy liquid, and at 178.5 °C (353.3 °F) it melts again and the cloudy liquid becomes clear. The phenomenon is reversible. Seeking help from a physicist, on March 14, 1888, he wrote to Otto Lehmann, at that time a Privatdozent in Aachen. They exchanged letters and samples. Lehmann examined the intermediate cloudy fluid, and reported seeing crystallites. Reinitzer's Viennese colleague von Zepharovich also indicated that the intermediate "fluid" was crystalline. The exchange of letters with Lehmann ended on April 24, with many questions unanswered. Reinitzer presented his results, with credits to Lehmann and von Zepharovich, at a meeting of the Vienna Chemical Society on May 3, 1888.
By that time, Reinitzer had discovered and described three important features of cholesteric liquid crystals (the name coined by Otto Lehmann in 1904): the existence of two melting points, the reflection of circularly polarized light, and the ability to rotate the polarization direction of light.
