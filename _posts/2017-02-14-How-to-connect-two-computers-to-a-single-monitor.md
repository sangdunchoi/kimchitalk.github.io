Required :

 * KVM Switch
 * Mouse
 * Keyboard
 * Monitor
 * Two computers


If you are in korea like me you can buy KVM Switch from [coupang](https://www.coupang.com/). Pricing starts from 17,000 KRW. Search using the keyword "KVM Switch".



I bought a model NETmate OC-62U.

It is very easy to connect. I have connected USB mouse and keyboard with the available USB ports and a monitor using VGA cable with the available port. KVM Switch has dual VGA cables. Connect these VGA cables to the CPUs.


I use Control key to switch the systems.
