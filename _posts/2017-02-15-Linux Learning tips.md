####  What is the best version of Linux for beginners?

- Try [Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop) or [Linux Mint](https://www.linuxmint.com/download.php). Best to use the recent versions.



#### Which version do you use?

- I use [Xubuntu](http://xubuntu.org/). Xubuntu comes with [Xfce](https://www.xfce.org/). I like Xfce desktop environment. Also, I have installed [Centos](https://www.centos.org/) in our workstation. One of best thing in linux OS is customization. Try few versions and choose your own.
