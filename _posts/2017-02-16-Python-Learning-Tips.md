One of my friend Chandramouli Balasubramanian was pushing me to learn python. So, I started learning to write small python scripts. Now I am learning machine learning using python for a project. In addition, now I am trying to create a GUI tool. I will update the blog soon. I am not an expert but I have few tips for beginners.

### Which python course do you suggest me?

* [Do automate boring stuffs](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/){:target="_blank"}. The book is free and is very good. First [15 videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1F_OgqRuSdI&list=PL0-84-yl1fUnRuXGFe_F7qSH1LEnn9LkW){:target="_blank"}  are free.



* [Software carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/blog/2013/10/python-for-biologists.html){:target="_blank"} for biologists.

### How people learned python? I need motivation. Can I read how people learned python?

* [I'm 32 years old, and just started my first full-time job as a developer. One year ago my programming knowledge was basically nil](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/34r807/im_32_years_old_and_just_started_my_first/){:target="_blank"}.
