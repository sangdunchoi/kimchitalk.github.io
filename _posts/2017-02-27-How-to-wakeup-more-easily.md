If I wakeup as usual per routine I do not have any issues in waking up. However, If I want to wakeup early or in a different schedule, it will be very hard to open my eyes. I feel very tired/sleepy whole day. Now, I plan with a sleep calculator.

Recently, I found a way to wakeup more easily.


* Go to any sleep calculator website for eg; [sleepyti.me](http://sleepyti.me/)

* Two options choose any one of them and keep the alarm accordingly
 
  - I have to wakeup at... 
  - Find out when to get up if you go to bed now

Sleep calculator helps me to wakeup more easily.
