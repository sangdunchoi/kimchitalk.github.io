*Arup Ghosh is about to graduate in Phd Industrial engineering. You can contact Arup in [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/Dr.ArupGhosh) and in [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arup-ghosh-95815a41)*

#### Where did you finish undergraduation?. 
I completed B.Tech in computer science at [West bengal university of technology](http://www.wbut.ac.in/). 

---
#### Why computer science?

I like mathematics. It is my assessment, those who take interest in mathematics will also enjoy in learning computer science. It's my assumption, implementing mathematics is computer science. Besides, I urged few of my uncles to do career assessment, it turn to be the same.

---
#### Where did you do your project in B.Tech?.

I did my project in [Machine Intelligent Unit](http://www.isical.ac.in/~miu/). I was not aware of research before, the exposure in Indian statistical institute was valuable. This is my favorite institute in India. I like the quality of research as well as teaching.


---
#### Tell me about your masters?

I did my masters in data mining at [University of trento](http://www.unitn.it/en). I was in the [Erasmus Mundus External Cooperation Window India4EU Programme](http://www.india4eu.polito.it). It was for 22 months.

---
#### How did you get into Erasmus Mundus Programme?

After I finished my B.Tech, I was looking for master programmes with fellowship. I noticed the programme information in our college. Two of my professors (Dr. B. Uma Shankar and Dr. Asrofi Khatun) guided me to apply. There was no interview for the programme but they allot scores from 10th onwards including bachelors. Other crucial factors were reference and motivational letters. If all that counterparts their cutoff score, the students will be selected.

---
#### Compare the student strengthw in your undergraduation and masters?

60 students were in B.tech and 30 students were in masters.


---
#### What was your project in your masters?

I accomplished my project with prof.Themis Palpanas. I could not decide the project. Hence, he advised me to do in DNA sequence mining related project. I cannot recall the full scope of the project since it was associated with biology. It is sort of benchmarking the algorithms in comparing the cancerous and normal genome sequences.

#### How did you come to Korea?

When I was in Italy, I contacted one Indian professor in software engineering department at Ajou University. He referred me to another Korean professor in industrial engineering who had a vacancy in computer science. 
I joined my Ph.D. under [Dr. Gi-Nam Wang](https://www.ajou.ac.kr/en/academics/academics02_02.jsp?include=view&article_no=199311050&board_wrapper=%2Fen%2Facademics%2Facademics02_02.jsp&pager.offset=0&board_no=420)

---
#### Did you gave Interview before joining PhD?

No

---
#### Can you explain your PhD work?

I do data analysis in car manufacturing industry. Industrial engineering is inter-disciplinary field. Mechanical, computer, electronics and electrical engineers all have distinctive duties in manufacturing units. All the data are recorded starting from the usage of electricity by machines, the input and output in manufacturing units. From the system, the input/output data will be available in Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) systems along with the electrical data (such as current, voltage, power etc.) from a energy meter device. We optimized certain reference data that we compare. Machine faults can be monitored and predicted using the data.

---
#### What are the advantages of automation in manufacturing units?

You can take any example for eg; tinned food packets. If you consider two tins both quality and quantity will be exactly same. Machine made will have consistency. The process will be completed very fast with low error rates.

---
#### Do you had course work in your PhD?

Yes. But I already took the same subjects in my masters. To such a degree, it was not sufficiently beneficial.

---
#### Which programming languages do you use here in Korea?

We use [C#](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)) in our lab. In Korea, mostly they use [DevExpress](https://www.devexpress.com/products/net/controls/winforms/get-started.xml) libraries (for Graphic User Interface controls) including our lab. It is a subscription based model.

---
#### Why did you use R language?

I have to invoke neural networking programs. It is challenging to implement codes for neural networking. There are numerous libraries available in [R](https://www.r-project.org/). And it is free and easy to implement.

---
#### How coding style differs in Korea?

My coding experience were mostly in academic environment. Here, the projects are mostly related to industries (in our lab) and they have certain guidelines. At first it was difficult to cope up. Certain guidelines that i remember are:

1) You have to wrap your functions within certain number of lines. If it surpasses you have to call another function.

2) I was coding in C but they demanded me to code in C#.

3) You have to write the comments precisely what appropriate chunk of code does. I was not doing that before.


---
#### Do you had any fellowships during PhD?

I have Brain Korean Government Scholarships.


---
#### Do you use linux?

I use windows in Korea. I never used linux in India. But I have used Ubuntu in Italy.

---
#### Do you have github repositories?

In Italy, my professor taught us about github repositories. But I dont have an active account now. In Korea, our work is related to industries thus we do not use github here (for publishing our codes/ideas). This is because it may violate the rules of the companies that provides us funding and data.

---
#### Can you suggest some tips for the people who want to learn coding?

Writing code is not hard. The approach is significant and a real bottleneck. Just write down the steps in plain English. Solve step by step, it will be easy.


---
#### You studied your B.Tech in India, masters in Italy and studying Phd in Korea. Can you comment on academic learning?

In India, mostly they expect us to have a solid theoretical knowledge than practicals. In Italy, both theory and practical are important. In Italy, even if you do not have enough theoretical knowledge, but you have implemented practically still they consider it. Korean side they look for practical implementations than the theory.


---
#### Do you like any teacher in schooldays and what is the reason for it?

I like history teacher since he is a good story teller. It was like listening to a melodrama. I don't like to read in schooldays. It was boring. Its my opinion that childhood is not to study but to play.


---
#### What are your future plans?

I have plans to start something on my own in health care industry. Otherwise, atleast, I will help someone who to wants to start.


---
#### What are other interest?

I read books both in Bengali and English. In Bengali, my favourite author is 
[Bibhutibhushan Bandyopadhyay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bibhutibhushan_Bandyopadhyay). I like his [Pather pachali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pather_Panchali_(novel)) novel the most.

In non-Bengali, I like [Maxim Gorky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxim_Gorky) writings. I like his [The Mother](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mother_(Gorky_novel)) novel most.
