#### Easy way is to use Google search preference than to use Chrome.

&nbsp;

1) Go to google search [preferences](https://www.google.com/preferences). I assume you have logged in with gmail id.

2) Toggle on the option 'Open each selected result in a new browser window.' See the below image for reference.

3) Save it.
