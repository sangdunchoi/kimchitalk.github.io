### [Quantum computer learns to ‘see’ trees](http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/03/quantum-computer-learns-see-trees)

In this news report, they highlight a [PLOS ONE study](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0172505&type=printable). There are a few points

The group has used quantum computer recognize trees using machine learning approach. The report says the results are slightly better to compare to classical computers. Classical computer stores information in binary units either using a 0 's and a 1 's whereas in quantum computers runs on a subatomic level using qubits (quantum bits). A comment by a user has a point. See the comment section in the news report.

*"What exactly is "quantum" about this problem? I don't see why this approach would be even "slightly more accurate than a conventional computer." Though not a true quantum computer, does D-Wave have some magical property that improves upon the plethora of deep learning classifiers out there?"*

The only difference between classical and quantum computers (regarding results) is speed. 

"There’s a popular belief that quantum computers do things that classical computers cannot, but the only difference is speed, says Itay Hen, a computer scientist at the University of Southern California in Marina del Rey, who was not involved with the research." 

This study lays down a groundwork for better climate forecasting. One of the problems in predicting the weather is speed. If we have high-speed system, we can guess the weather soon so that it can avoid devastation says [Ramakrishna Nemani](https://ecocast.arc.nasa.gov/peop/rama.php)

### [Meet WHO’s dirty dozen: The 12 bacteria for which new drugs are most urgently needed](http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/02/meet-who-s-dirty-dozen-12-bacteria-which-new-drugs-are-most-urgently-needed).

"The list is not meant to scare people about new superbugs, but to signal to researchers and pharmaceutical companies what their priorities should be, Marie-Paule Kieny, WHO’s assistant director-general for health systems and innovation, told a press conference today."

##### Priority 1: Critical

* Acinetobacter baumannii, carbapenem-resistant
* Pseudomonas aeruginosa, carbapenem-resistant
* Enterobacteriaceae*, carbapenem-resistant, 3rd generation cephalosporin-resistant

##### Priority 2: High

* Enterococcus faecium, vancomycin-resistant
* Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant, vancomycin intermediate and resistant
* Helicobacter pylori, clarithromycin-resistant
* Campylobacter, fluoroquinolone-resistant
* Salmonella spp., fluoroquinolone-resistant
* Neisseria gonorrhoeae, 3rd generation cephalosporin-resistant, fluoroquinolone-resistant

##### Priority 3: Medium

* Streptococcus pneumoniae, penicillin-non-susceptible
* Haemophilus influenzae, ampicillin-resistant
* Shigella spp., fluoroquinolone-resistant

"The top three are all gram-negative bacteria that are resistant to multiple drugs. They aren’t widespread yet, but they do cause severe, frequently deadly infections in hospitals, especially in people who are already immune compromised—including transplant recipients, chemotherapy patients, and elderly people. Just last month, for instance, a woman in Nevada died of an infection with a so-called CRE or carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae."

"Nine more pathogens round out the agency’s dirty dozen: Six are listed as high priority, including drug-resistant strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, which causes gonorrhea, and food-borne agents like Salmonella and Campylobacter. Bacteria in this category cause infections that are less deadly than those caused by the three critical-level bugs, but they are much more widespread. Three “medium” priority organisms all are susceptible to some drugs, but are increasingly becoming resistant."

### [Open-data contest unearths scientific gems — and controversy](http://www.nature.com/news/open-data-contest-unearths-scientific-gems-and-controversy-1.21572)

Those who are going to take medicine have every right to see the data. How to trust the data provided by the company. One way to make public trust in science is to make the data publically available. The below ~~code~~ quote fits here

A lack of transparency results in distrust and a deep sense of insecurity - Dalai Lama

How to fix this problem?.

"Wright worries that hundreds of researchers are now picking through the data while the SPRINT investigators are still busy closing down the trial. Others who had nothing to do with the trial are able to publish a lot faster than we are, he says. The return on investment is dramatically reduced for the investigators in SPRINT, no question.”

### [Neanderthal tooth plaque hints at meals — and kisses](http://www.nature.com/news/neanderthal-tooth-plaque-hints-at-meals-and-kisses-1.21593)

The below point does make sense.

"Hervé Bocherens, a palaeobiologist at the University of Tübingen, Germany, is unconvinced that the plaque DNA identifies meals and dietary differences. Databases of plant and animal DNA tend to lack the extinct species that Neanderthals would have eaten, and previous studies have suggested that both groups ate meat. At the moment I would not consider the conclusion robust, he says."
