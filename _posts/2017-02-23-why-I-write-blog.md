It is easy to setup a blog using github and jekyll. I liked [mlampros blog](http://mlampros.github.io/) [Thank you mlampros] so forked and start using it. 

I started a blog in 2014 somehow I couldn't continously update it. So I started it again. For several years I used to share interesting articles and videos to my friends (around 30) through email.  The articles were mostly related to science that are worth reading and that interests me. There are two things that motivated me to a write blog.

1) I read a [blog post](https://emptysqua.re/blog/write-an-excellent-programming-blog/) by [A. Jesse Jiryu Davis](https://twitter.com/jessejiryudavis). Thank you Davis for motivating.

2) The Tamil writer [JeyaMohan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B._Jeyamohan) once said in a interview that we have enough technology to run a newspaper today without anybody's support. But, still we don't bring any positive change. Thank you JeyaMohan sir for motivating.

Both their thoughts somehow echoed in my ears for a long time.


* I will write related to Science, Engineering and Technology. 

* I used to get hoax messages in WhatsApp. Just to make me and others aware I will write about it.

* I will write codes and try to explain. 

* I will write about interesting science stories that I read.

* I will write a series of interviews of my friends who has PhDs. This will help me to understand different areas atleast in broader context. And, also to understand their perspectives. In addition, I will try to understand the specific problems faced by students, teachers in Indian as well as other universities. The posts are not to critize anyone but somehow to understand the problems specifically faced by both students as well as teachers.

* Writing helps me to improve my writing skills. I do make grammatical mistakes if i am aware of it I will correct. So bear me for that. I am part of generation who doesn't know proper English as well as our mother tongue.

* I will also share interesting documentary, interviews, and speeches in my mother tongue Tamil, Hindi, and English.

* Sharing is caring.


Thank you for reading.
